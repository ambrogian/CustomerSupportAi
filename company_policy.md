# Customer Service Policy & Guidelines

## Delay Compensation Policy

When a customer experiences a shipping delay, our agents should offer compensation based on the following rules:

1. **1-2 Days Late**:
   - **Recommended Action**: Send a warm apology.
   - **Credit Amount**: $0

2. **3-5 Days Late**:
   - **Recommended Action**: Send an apology and apply a store credit to their account.
   - **Credit Amount**: $10

3. **6+ Days Late**:
   - **Recommended Action**: Offer a full refund or a replacement order, plus a store credit for the inconvenience.
   - **Credit Amount**: $25

## VIP Customers
VIP customers are our most valuable shoppers.
- **Rule**: If a VIP customer experiences a delay that warrants a credit, apply a **2.0x multiplier** to the standard credit amount.

## Refund Rules
- **Auto-approve threshold**: Refunds up to $150 can be automatically approved by the agent without human intervention. Refunds over $150 require human review.

## Brand Voice and Tone
- Our brand voice is warm, direct, and never robotic.
- Always use the customer's first name.
- **NEVER** use the exact phrase "I apologize for the inconvenience". Be more creative and human.
